# Claude Development Guidelines for AirBorne

This document provides instructions for Claude (AI assistant) when working on the AirBorne project.

---

## Primary Directive: Follow the Plan

**ALWAYS follow `plan.md`** as the authoritative source of truth for implementation.

- Work through phases sequentially (Phase 0 ‚Üí Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí ...)
- Complete all tasks within a phase before moving to the next
- Do not skip tasks unless explicitly instructed
- Do not deviate from the architecture without discussion

---

## Progress Tracking

### Update plan.md

As you complete tasks, **update `plan.md`** to track progress:

1. **Mark completed tasks** by adding a checkbox:
   ```markdown
   #### 1.1: Implement Event Bus (1 hour) ‚úÖ
   **Status**: COMPLETED - 2025-10-12
   ```

2. **Track current task** being worked on:
   ```markdown
   #### 1.2: Implement Message Queue (2 hours) üöß
   **Status**: IN PROGRESS - Started 2025-10-12
   ```

3. **Add notes** for deviations or important decisions:
   ```markdown
   #### 1.3: Implement Plugin Interface (2 hours)
   **Status**: COMPLETED - 2025-10-12
   **Notes**: Added additional `on_error()` method for error handling
   ```

4. **Update milestones** when reached:
   ```markdown
   ### M1: Core Framework Complete (End of Phase 1) ‚úÖ
   **Completed**: 2025-10-15
   **Notes**: All tests passing, ready for Phase 2
   ```

---

## When Unsure: Ask Questions

**DO NOT guess or make assumptions** when uncertain. Instead:

1. **Stop and ask** the user for clarification
2. **Explain the ambiguity** you've encountered
3. **Propose options** if multiple approaches are possible
4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding

### Examples of When to Ask

- Unclear requirements in plan.md
- Multiple valid implementation approaches
- Design decision needed (not specified in plan)
- Dependency or library selection
- Configuration format or structure
- User preference for features

### Good Question Format

```
I'm working on [Task X] and encountered [ambiguity/choice].

Options:
1. [Approach A] - [pros/cons]
2. [Approach B] - [pros/cons]

My recommendation: [Approach A] because [reason].

How would you like me to proceed?
```

---

## Phase Completion Assessment

At the **end of each phase**, perform a comprehensive assessment:

**Completion Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

**Summary**: Brief description of what was accomplished.

**Code Quality**: Excellent / Good / Needs Improvement

**Test Coverage**: All tests passing / Some failures / No tests

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes / No (if no, explain why)
```

---

## Unit Testing Requirements

**Write unit tests for every component** to ensure correctness.

### Testing Standards

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for >80% code coverage
   - Test all public methods
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Test integration points between plugins

2. **Test Location**
   - Mirror source structure in `tests/` directory
   - Example: `src/airborne/core/event_bus.py` ‚Üí `tests/core/test_event_bus.py`

3. **Test Naming**
   - Use descriptive test names: `test_event_bus_dispatches_to_subscribers`
   - Follow pattern: `test_[unit]_[scenario]_[expected_result]`

4. **Test Structure**
   ```python
   def test_feature_name():
       """Test description of what is being tested."""
       # Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
       event_bus = EventBus()
       handler_called = False

       def handler(event):
           nonlocal handler_called
           handler_called = True

       # Act: Execute the code being tested
       event_bus.subscribe(TestEvent, handler)
       event_bus.publish(TestEvent())

       # Assert: Verify the expected results
       assert handler_called, "Handler should have been called"
   ```

5. **Use pytest Fixtures**
   ```python
   import pytest

   @pytest.fixture
   def event_bus():
       """Provide a fresh EventBus instance for each test."""
       return EventBus()

   def test_subscription(event_bus):
       # Test using the fixture
       pass
   ```

6. **Mock External Dependencies**
   ```python
   from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

   def test_audio_engine_plays_sound():
       mock_bass = Mock()
       with patch('pybass.BASS_ChannelPlay', mock_bass):
           engine = PyBassAudioEngine()
           engine.play_sound("test.wav")
           mock_bass.assert_called_once()
   ```

### When to Write Tests

- **Before implementation** (TDD): Write test first, then implement
- **During implementation**: Write tests alongside code
- **After implementation**: Verify with tests immediately

**Never move to next task without tests for current task.**

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/core/test_event_bus.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src/airborne --cov-report=html

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

---

## Documentation Standards

Follow **industry-standard Python documentation** practices to enable auto-generation of developer docs.

### Docstring Format: Google Style

Use **Google-style docstrings** (compatible with Sphinx, pdoc, mkdocs):

```python
def function_name(param1: int, param2: str) -> bool:
    """Brief one-line description of function.

    More detailed description if needed. Explain what the function does,
    not how it does it (that's for comments in the code).

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1. Be specific about type expectations,
            valid ranges, and any constraints.
        param2: Description of param2. Include examples if helpful.

    Returns:
        Description of return value. Explain what it represents and any
        special values (None, empty list, etc.).

    Raises:
        ValueError: When param1 is negative.
        RuntimeError: When external resource is unavailable.

    Examples:
        >>> function_name(42, "test")
        True
        >>> function_name(0, "")
        False

    Note:
        Any important notes, warnings, or usage tips.
    """
    pass
```

### Class Documentation

```python
class ClassName:
    """Brief one-line description of class.

    Longer description explaining the purpose, responsibilities, and
    usage of this class. Explain design decisions if relevant.

    Attributes:
        attr1: Description of public attribute.
        attr2: Description of public attribute.

    Examples:
        >>> obj = ClassName(param=value)
        >>> obj.method()
        'result'

    Note:
        Important usage notes or warnings.
    """

    def __init__(self, param: str):
        """Initialize ClassName.

        Args:
            param: Description of initialization parameter.
        """
        self.attr1 = param
        self._private_attr = None  # Private attrs don't need docstring

    def public_method(self) -> str:
        """Public methods must have full docstrings."""
        pass

    def _private_method(self):
        """Private methods can have brief docstrings."""
        pass
```

### Module Documentation

Every module (`.py` file) should have a module-level docstring:

```python
"""Brief description of module purpose.

This module provides functionality for X. It is part of the Y subsystem
and is typically used for Z purposes.

Typical usage example:
    from airborne.core import module_name

    obj = module_name.ClassName()
    result = obj.method()

Note:
    Any important module-level information.
"""

import statements
...
```

### Type Hints

**Always use type hints** for function signatures:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Tuple, Callable, Any

def process_data(
    items: List[str],
    config: Dict[str, Any],
    callback: Optional[Callable[[str], None]] = None
) -> Tuple[int, List[str]]:
    """Process data with type hints."""
    pass
```

### Inline Comments

Use inline comments for **complex logic only**:

```python
# Good: Explains non-obvious logic
# Calculate lift using simplified aerodynamic equation
# L = 0.5 * œÅ * v¬≤ * S * Cl
lift = 0.5 * air_density * velocity**2 * wing_area * lift_coefficient

# Bad: States the obvious
# Increment counter by 1
counter += 1
```

### Documentation Generation

To generate developer documentation:

```bash
# Using pdoc (recommended)
uv run pdoc --html --output-dir docs src/airborne

# Using Sphinx (alternative)
cd docs
uv run sphinx-build -b html source build
```

### Documentation Checklist

For every file you create or modify:

- [ ] Module-level docstring at top
- [ ] All public classes have docstrings
- [ ] All public methods have docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises
- [ ] Complex algorithms have inline comments
- [ ] Type hints on all function signatures
- [ ] Examples in docstrings for complex usage

## Problem-Solving Approach

When encountering issues:

1. **Reproduce the issue** reliably
2. **Write a failing test** that demonstrates the bug
3. **Debug systematically**:
   - Add logging/print statements
   - Use Python debugger (pdb)
   - Check assumptions
4. **Fix the issue** with minimal changes
5. **Verify the test passes** now
6. **Check for regressions** (run all tests)
7. **Document the fix** (commit message, code comments)
