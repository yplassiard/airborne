"""Navigation database and flight planning systems.

This module provides functionality for navigation aids, waypoints, and
flight planning capabilities.

Typical usage:
    from airborne.navigation import NavDatabase, Navaid

    db = NavDatabase()
    db.load_from_csv("data/navigation")

    vor = db.find_navaid("SFO")
    nearby = db.find_navaids_near(position, radius_nm=50)
