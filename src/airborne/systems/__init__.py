"""Aircraft systems package.

This package contains abstract base classes and concrete implementations
for aircraft systems (electrical, fuel, engines, etc.).

The modular design allows different aircraft to use different system implementations
based on their specific needs (e.g., Cessna 172 uses 12V electrical, Boeing 737 uses 28V).
