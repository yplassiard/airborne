# AirBorne

A blind-accessible flight simulator with self-voicing capabilities, realistic physics, and comprehensive aircraft systems simulation.

## Features

- **Fully Accessible**: Self-voicing with TTS, no visual interface required
- **Realistic Physics**: 6DOF flight model with authentic aerodynamics
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular, extensible system design
- **Complete Aircraft Systems**: Engines, electrical, hydraulics, fuel, avionics
- **Interactive Checklists**: Step-by-step procedures with auto-verification
- **Ground Navigation**: Airport database, taxiway guidance with audio cues
- **ATC Communications**: Realistic radio communications and phraseology
- **AI Traffic**: Simulated aircraft for TCAS and realism
- **Network Ready**: Multiplayer and live ATC support (planned)
